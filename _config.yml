title: Beachlab
description: Dr Daniel Harris and the Beach Lab are part of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at The University of Queensland. Dan focuses on the processes that change coastal and marine systems from the river catchments to the continental shelf (…or wherever there’s water). Beaches and coral reefs are the main focus of this research and Dr Harris is always looking to work with students and researchers who are passionate about the coast.
Dr Harris also teaches undergraduate and post-graduate marine science, oceanography, environmental management and geography courses. These subjects provide a foundation for studying and monitoring marine and environmental systems with options to delve into a more advanced assessment of coastal and coral reef change at Honours and Masters levels. Dr Harris is motivated to conduct high quality research that will lead to well informed management and conservation of our coasts and marine systems. This is driven by a passion for the marine environment which stems from years of snorkeling on the reef and playing in the waves on the east coast of Australia.
