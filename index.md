**Introduction**
Dr Daniel Harris and the Beach Lab are part of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at The University of Queensland. Dan focuses on the processes that change coastal and marine systems from the river catchments to the continental shelf (…or wherever there’s water). Beaches and coral reefs are the main focus of this research and Dr Harris is always looking to work with students and researchers who are passionate about the coast.
