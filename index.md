**Introduction**

I am a geographer and marine scientist who runs a research group "the Beachlab" at The University of Queensland. The focus of my work, and that of my group, is on the processes that change coastal and marine systems over a range of spatial (from one wave to the entire globe) and temporal (seconds to millenia) scales.
