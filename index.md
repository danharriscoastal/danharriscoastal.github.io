Dan Harris and the Beachlab are part of the School of Earth and Environmental Sciences at The University of Queensland. Dan focuses on the processes that change coastal and marine systems from the river catchments to the continental shelf. Beaches and coral reefs are the main focus of this research.

The research conducted in the Beachlab is multi-disciplinary and multi-scaled. The active research projects in the beachlab highlight this focus, they include: the transformation of waves in the surf zones of coral reefs and beaches, quanitfying the coastal proection service provided by coral reefs, and investigating the influence of sea level and wave climate on coastal and coral reef evolution during the quaternary. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide tools to create or maintain resilient coasts in the face of a changing climate and rising sea levels.

We employ a suite of data collection methods and models to conduct this research and are always seeking motivated students and researchers to work with. A few research topics are listed below in the research link. The website is sporadically updated so feel profile to peruse the research profiles of Dan at [UQ](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16758) which contains most of the research output links you might be interested in.
