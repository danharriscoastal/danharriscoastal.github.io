The Beachlab is part of the School of the Environment at The University of Queensland. Dr Daniel Harris is the leader of the Beachlab. Dan focuses on the processes that change coastal and marine systems from the river catchments to the continental shelf (…or wherever there’s water).

The goal of the Beachlab is to develop tools, gather data, and provide analyses to help coastlines and coral reefs navigate a warmer world. Our projects are focused on fundamental research questions about how coasts and coral reefs change through time. We also have applied research objectives to support the future management of coastal and coral reef systems.

The research conducted in the Beachlab is multi-disciplinary and multi-scaled. The active research projects in the beachlab highlight this focus, they include: the transformation of waves in the surf zones of coral reefs and beaches, modelling wave climate in coral reef settings over days to decades, quanitfying the coastal protection service provided by coral reefs, investigating the influence of sea level and wave climate on coastal and coral reef evolution during the quaternary, using machine learning and satellite remote sensing to understand change in coral reefs and beaches at global scales, and investigating the role of coral rubble in the long-term dyanmics and recovery of coral reef ecosystems. 

We employ a suite of data collection methods and models to conduct this research and are always seeking motivated students and researchers to work with. A few research topics are listed below in the research link. The website is sporadically updated so feel profile to peruse the research profiles of Dan at [UQ](https://researchers.uq.edu.au/researcher/16758) which contains most of the research output links you might be interested in.

For students who may be interested in research projects within the Beachlab see the list [here](./student_projects.html)

**Teaching**

Teaching is a core component of the work conducted by members of the Beachlab and Dan is a passionate teacher covering many topics in geography and marine science (see list of courses taught at UQ as evidence). The goal of the courses and content we teach is to provide a base of skills and knowledge that students can build off in their future academic and professional careers. The content in the lectures always link to the workshops, practicals and field work components of the course. We use real world data, models and examples in our workshops but take care to do the ground work to ensure we can spend time teaching the critical content and knowledge even when using advanced software. Where possible, we also teach in the field to immerse students in the natural systems they are studying and working on. We run multiple field trips to Minjerribah - North Stradbroke Island and Heron Island.
