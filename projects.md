The Beachlab is a research group devoted to understanding coastal processes. The energy and material that moves through the coastal zone over time. The time frames we investigate stretch from minutes to millennia, covering short-term transformation of individual waves to glacial/interglacial cycles of sea level change and coral reef growth. 

The research conducted in the Beachlab is multi-disciplinary and multi-scaled. The active research projects in the beachlab highlight this focus, they include: the transformation of waves in the surf zones of coral reefs and beaches, modelling wave climate in coral reef settings over days to decades, quanitfying the coastal protection service provided by coral reefs, investigating the influence of sea level and wave climate on coastal and coral reef evolution during the quaternary, using machine learning and satellite remote sensing to understand change in coral reefs and beaches at global scales, and investigating the role of coral rubble in the long-term dyanmics and recovery of coral reef ecosystems. 


**Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) â€“ Rubble Stabilisation.**
The mobility of coral rubble is a primary factor in governing the recruitment of new corals and recovery of coral reefs after major disturbances such as bleaching and cyclone event. The more mobile the rubble the less likely coral recruits will survive. However, there is a paucity of research and knowledge on the dynamics and generation of coral rubble. This project seeks to understand the in situ processes driving coral rubble transport and is part of the broader RRAP - Rubble Stablisation project led by Prof. Peter Mumby and Prof. Tom Baldock with PhD candidate Su Zhou driving the core research in the project.
