There is a large world beyond academia and here are a few things I'm up to clear the mind and stay healthy :)

If you have any suggestions feel free to let me know!

## New Music Fridays

Some background....TL:DR links below to some playlists that are great.

I started out in music before moving into science. It only lasted a year but it's a story I never stop telling the students I teach since I think it makes me windswept and interesting. The creativity, commitment and effort in writing or performing music is not as different as you might think to really good research. Life became busier after the PhD and I lost track of new music. This was partly due to living in Germany at the time and no longer listening to Triple J and FBI in Sydney. I basically haven't updated my playlists since 2013. So I'm attempting to rectify this and flex the music muscles a bit more. A few links I'm currently liking below...
