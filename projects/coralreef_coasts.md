The Beachlab investigates the processes that change coral reefs and the coast. A few of the most recent projects are outlined below


**1. Coral reefs, climate change, and coastal protection**

The Beachlab has built a suite of tools to investigate wave breaking and transformation across coral reefs. Some of this research focuses solely on the science of waves and sediment transport and how it describes features on coral reefs (e.g. Harris et al. 2014, 2015a and 2018). This work culminated in research that investigated the change in wave processes on coral reefs in a future of higher sea levels and degraded reefs (Harris et al. 2018). We have continued to progress and there are currently a number of student projects that focus on detailing the links between hydrodynamics and coral reef geomorphology and benthic community.


**2. Beaches: Morphodynamics and change**

**3. Hydrodynamics: surf zone processes**

**4. Holocene sea level change: Coral Reefs**

**5. Planning, management, and policy of the coasts**

This area of reasearch is still emerging
